# SFML-LineDrawing
This is the SFML version of what I did in Xorg. I wanted to have fun and redo what I did in SFML

# Dependencies
SFML

# Compiling and running this application
If you're on Linux just run the make file with ```make``` it should output an a.out file, run that output file.<br>

# Windows
I mainly like making my projects in Linux, however, you can technically run this in Windows too.
